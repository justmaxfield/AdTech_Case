# AdTech_Case
A sample case study for a fictional advertising technology company looking to provide a client with insightful analytics.


Case Study
SITUATION
AdveriCorp’s EVP of Sales has a meeting coming up with “Chevlour: Advanced Hair Coloring for Women”, a hair coloring brand of a large upscale cosmetics company. He has asked the Sales Engineering team to come up with “something interesting” that will demonstrate to the client that AdveriCorp can:
(1) Help inform the client’s understanding of the Chevlour brand consumer.
(2) Activate media that will allow Chevlour to drive sales.
A list of consumers who have recently purchased Chevlour has already been processed through AdveriCorp’s internal “Audience Insights” tool to produce a comparison of how prevalent those shoppers are across AdveriCorp’s audience segments versus AdveriCorp’s 257 million records of people in the U.S. From the attached spreadsheet, you must further process of these segments to accomplish the following tasks…
TASKS
(1) Generate a list from the 3rd Party Segments, of those have a large enough sample to be meaningful
(regardless of how relevant they are to the brand).
(2) How do the Chevlour Purchaser age ranges compare to the general population?
(3) Generate a short list of Segments that would be interesting/relevant to the client.
(4) Continuing from (1)(3), what are some segments that are interesting/relevant but contradict the
Purchaser Profile?
(5) What general conclusions can you draw about the consumer’s Magazine reading habits? Do they
confirm or dispute the below Purchaser Profile? Tell us anything new?
(6) Knowing that AdveriCorp can digitally target people in any of the Segments in the attached spreadsheet,generate a list of 3rd Party and/or Magazine Segments that could be used to help craft an actionable digital advertising strategy for the client.

IMPORTANT NOTES
(1) Be prepared to discuss HOW you came up your answers and WHY. (This is just as important as the
answer itself.)
(2) You don’t need to create a polished presentation. Just make sure your answers are clear enough to
discuss during the interview.
(3) There are no right or wrong answers. Don’t expect an a-ha moment. You will be evaluated on the Art, the Science, and knowing when to use which.
(4) Data is often dirty. There may be typos in the segment names or inconsistencies in the numbers. Use your best judgment when interpreting segment data. Or clean it up yourself (noting where and why you adjusted the data).
