# AdTech_Case
A sample case study for a fictional advertising technology company looking to provide a client with insightful analytics.

Instructions.docx provides a list of detailed instructions for completing the case study.
The pdf and xlsx files complement one another in presenting the case study.  The original data can be found in the Data-ThirdPartySegments and Data-MagazineSegments sheets.

While all of the analyses were performed in Excel with no coding needed, I hope it provides an example of the thought process behind a real-world problem with the aid of visualizations.
